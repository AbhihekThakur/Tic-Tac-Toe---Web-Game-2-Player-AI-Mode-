# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe - Web Game (2 Player + AI Mode)

Welcome to **Tic Tac Toe**—but with some sauce! This isn’t your dusty pen-and-paper game. This is a responsive, theme-switching, audio-buzzing browser game with both **2-player** mode and an AI that plays like it’s had one too many energy drinks.

## 🧠 Features

- ✌️ **2 Player Mode** – Challenge your bestie and prove who's the real X or O boss.
- 🤖 **Single Player Mode** – Face off against a smart AI (Minimax algorithm with zero chill).
- 🎵 **Sound Effects** – Win? Draw? Background vibes? It’s all in there.
- 🌗 **Theme Toggle** – Light or Dark, pick your aesthetic.
- 🔇 **Mute Option** – For when you're vibing in silence.
- 🏁 **Pause, Restart, and Score Reset** – Full control at your fingertips.
- 📱 **Responsive UI** – Looks good on desktop *and* mobile.
